  dinosourDescription: Deinocheirus is a genus of large ornithomimosaur that lived
    during the Late Cretaceous around 70 million years ago.  Deinocheirus was an
    unusual ornithomimosaur, the largest of the clade at 11 m long, and weighing
    6.5 t.  The arms were among the largest of any bipedal dinosaur at 2.4 m long,
    with large, blunt claws on its three-fingered hands. The legs were relatively
    short, and bore blunt claws. Deinocheirus is thought to have been omnivorous.
