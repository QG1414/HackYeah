  dinosourDescription: Dracorex - a herbivorous dinosaur from the pachycephalosaur
    family. His name (Dracorex hogwartsia) means "dragon king of Hogwarts". He lived
    in the Late Cretaceous era (approx. 71-65 million years ago) in North America.
    Body length approx. 3 m, height approx. 1.5 m, weight approx. 80-90 kg. His remains
    were found in the South Dakota (USA). Some paleontologists speculate that the
    fossils referred to as Dracorex and Stygimoloch actually belong to young and
    adolescent pachycephalosaur.
