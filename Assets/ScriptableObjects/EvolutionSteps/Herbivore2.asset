  dinosourDescription: "Ankylosaurus is a genus of armored dinosaur. Its fossils
    have been found in geological formations dating to the very end of the Cretaceous
    Period, about 68\u201366 million years ago, in western North America. Ankylosaurus
    is estimated to have been between 6 and 8 meters long and to have weighed between
    4.8 and 8 tons.  The tail club is thought to have been used in defense against
    predators. Ankylosaurus also lived alongside dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus
    and Triceratops"
