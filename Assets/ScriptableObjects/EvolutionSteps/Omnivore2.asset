  dinosourDescription: "Struthiomimus is a genus of ornithomimid dinosaurs from the
    late Cretaceous of North America.  Ornithomimids were long-legged, bipedal, ostrich-like
    dinosaurs with toothless beaks. Their overall abundance\u2014in addition to their
    toothless beak\u2014suggests that these animals were mainly herbivorous or omnivorous,
    rather than purely carnivorous, if at all."
